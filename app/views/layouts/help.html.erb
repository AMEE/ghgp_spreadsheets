    <h3 class="instructions">2. The optional input fields which allow you to customise the calculations are hidden by default so you can click 'Show optional inputs' to make all fields available.</h3>
    <h3 class="instructions">3. A guide to the contents and calculations on each tab can be opened by clicking the 'Guide' tab, just above the table.</h3>
    <h3 class="instructions">4. Make calculations by entering data into each table row.</h3>
    <h3 class="instructions">5. You can add associated details (e.g. reporting period, process descriptors) to calculations to match your internal references.</h3>

    <h2 class="instructions">Adding additional users...</h2>
    <h3 class="instructions">1. To add another user to the app go to the Admin page via the link in the top right hand corner of the screen and click to 'Add a new user'.</h3>
    <h3 class="instructions">2. Enter the users email and select a password for them.  Once set up you need to share these with the user and give them the link to sign in. They can reset their password in the 'Settings' page once they sign in for the first time.</h3>
